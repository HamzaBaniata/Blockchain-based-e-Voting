### E-voting System

This repository contains a novel smart contract designed to facilitate a differentially private election process on a Blockchain Network.

The JavaScript files utilize the web3 package to compile the smart contract, deploy it over the network, simulate an election, and conduct tests to measure its performance.

This code is a part of an ongoing research project targeting a new Blockchain-based e-Voting system that utilizes Smart Contracts, Differential Privacy, and Self-Sovereign Identity. Scientific paper that describes all research elements are currently under review and will be indicated here once published. Several future enhancements and updates are currently being optimized.
