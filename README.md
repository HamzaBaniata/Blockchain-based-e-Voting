### E-voting System

This repository contains a novel smart contract designed to facilitate a differentially private election process on a Blockchain Network.

The JavaScript files utilize the web3 package to compile the smart contract, deploy it over the network, simulate an election, and conduct tests to measure its performance.

This code is a part of an ongoing research project targeting a new Blockchain-based e-Voting system that utilizes Smart Contracts, Differential Privacy, and Self-Sovereign Identity. Scientific paper that describes all research elements is published in IEEE-Access:

Suggestions are much welcome!

NOTE: This solution was mainly defined and designed by Dr. Hamza Baniata, and it was implemented and evaluated by Giovanny Calu√±a as part of his M.Sc. thesis. Code is available at:
